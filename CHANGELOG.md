# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-08

First tagged release. The system has been in daily use for some time; `1.0.0`
marks the point at which instances stop tracking a moving `main` and start
syncing to tested cuts. Entries below describe what `1.0.0` contains, not a
delta from an earlier release.

### Added — release engineering

- **Versioned release channel.** `sync-system.sh` is channel-aware: instances on
  `AI_MEMORY_CHANNEL=release` (the default) sync to the latest stable `v*` tag
  and never to raw `main`. `AI_MEMORY_CHANNEL=dev` keeps the fast-forward pull.
- **`--to <ref>`** for one-shot pin, rollback, dogfood, or bisect. Ephemeral: it
  never changes the channel, and the next plain sync returns the instance to its
  channel default on both channels.
- **Migration runner.** `migrations/<semver>-<slug>.sh` run between checkout and
  `install.sh`, forward-only, idempotent, in ascending semver order. The
  gitignored `.applied-version` marker is written after each success, so a
  failed migration is resumable. Downgrades run nothing.
- **`release.sh`** — a guarded, idempotent, resumable tag cut. Refuses on a dirty
  tree, a non-`main` branch, divergence from `origin/main`, an existing tag, a
  non-monotonic version, or a failing test suite. Refuses outright when
  `AI_MEMORY_ROLE` is set, so a delegated executor can never publish a release.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` and `UPGRADING.md`**, the latter carrying the two standing
  rules: migrations are forward-only and idempotent, and a migration must not
  break the previous release's code (N/N+1 compatibility).

### Added — the memory system

- **Markdown-only memory** across three layers: `identity.md` (hard rules),
  `domain/*.md` and `projects/*/memory.md` (durable), `projects/*/working.md`
  (scratchpad). No database, no daemon, no MCP server.
- **Hook-injected context.** The full payload arrives at session start, on
  `@memory`, and on the first prompt after compaction; every other prompt gets a
  lightweight breadcrumb.
- **Harness-agnostic, manifest-driven engine.** `install.sh` resolves a harness
  from `harnesses/<name>/manifest` and wires it. Registered: `claude` and
  `antigravity` (hook archetype) and `codex` (file archetype). Adding a harness
  is a manifest, not engine code.
- **Orchestrator / Executor / Validator workflow**, with `executor.sh` resolving
  `--role task` and `--role explore` through the harness manifest.
- **Task-provider layer** — a pluggable capture/track backend (`local`, `notion`)
  behind `/task` and `/start`, with `/start` running a design gate before
  scaffolding a plan.
- **Skill subsystem** — authored skills in `skills/`, remote skills declared in
  `skills.toml` and materialized into a lockfile-pinned cache. Referenced, not
  forked.
- **Derived projections** — `/state` (in-flight work across projects) and
  `/activity` (plans created in a window, grouped by category). Regenerated,
  never authored.
- **Harness-neutral project marker** `.agents/memory-project`, with a legacy
  `.claude/memory-project` fallback and `migrate-marker.sh` to bulk-migrate.
